#3cns Core Application

This repo contains 3 Parts of the Project One as Core Laravel Project that functions as the API backend asn servers the static assets and two submodules which require compiling.

- Angular2 frontend (submodule at path resoureces/assets/frontend)
- Vue.js Chat Feature (submodule at path resoureces/assets/frontend)
   - This includes the Chat Widget and the SocketIO server code

Specific dev instructions are located in each of the submodules


To update the Core assets and move them into the public
resource folder you should run `npm run dev` which will
copy the Frontend and Chat dist assets to their respective final destinations.
You will want to compile them for the specific env prior to performing this action.



The Socket Server Can be started for dev

```
npm run chat-socket
```

And managed w/ forever using
```
 NODE_ENV=stage forever start -o ./socket/logs/chat_socket.out.log -e ./socket/logs/chat_socket.out.log socket/app.js
 NODE_ENV=production forever start -o ./socket/logs/chat_socket.out.log -e ./socket/logs/chat_socket.out.log socket/app.js
```


There are also process jobs so make sure the workers are running
```
php artisan queue:work
```
